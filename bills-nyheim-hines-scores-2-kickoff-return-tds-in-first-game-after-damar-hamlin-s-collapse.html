Here’s what you need to know:</p><ul><li>Buffalo locked up the No. 2 seed in the AFC with the victory and <a href=#>will play the Dolphins</a>, who secured the final AFC wild-card spot with a win over the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=52 href=#>Jets</a>.</li><li><a href=#>Hines</a>’ first touchdown was a 96-yard run on the opening play of the game, sending his team and the stadium into an emotional frenzy. The second was a 101-yard run midway through the third quarter, reclaiming the lead for Buffalo.</li><li>Bills quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9zLTUSPpy6pFa4xs href=#>Josh Allen</a> went 19-of-31 passing for 254 yards and three touchdowns. Patriots QB <a class=ath_autolink data-id=18zaLFAmDNfVSyfc href=#>Mac Jones</a> went 26-of-40 with three touchdowns and three interceptions; the loss knocked New England out of playoff contention.</li><li>Players and fans paid tribute to Hamlin in multiple ways before and during the matchup. While huddling up before going into victory formation inside the final two minutes, the entire Bills offense raised three fingers to the stadium. Everyone responded and broke into a “Ham-lin! Ham-lin!” chant.</li></ul><h2>Backstory</h2><p>Hamlin, 24, said in a social media post Saturday night, his first public comments since the incident, that <a href=#>“the love has been overwhelming.”</a></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Earlier Saturday, doctors at UC Medical Center said Hamlin remains in critical condition, but “continues to breathe on his own” and described his neurological function as “excellent,” according to a team statement.</p><p>Doctors removed Hamlin’s breathing tube overnight Friday, and he FaceTimed with coaches and players during Friday’s team meeting, the franchise said. In an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">update provided Friday</a>, Buffalo said Hamlin “continues to progress remarkably in his recovery.”</p><p>Bills coach Sean McDermott told reporters Friday the coaching staff surprised players with the video call with Hamlin. When Hamlin appeared on the screen, he flexed both biceps and made a heart with his hands before saying “Love you boys.”</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">In social media posts Sunday morning</a>, Hamlin said, “There’s nothing I want more than to be running out that tunnel with my brothers. God using me in a different way today! Tell someone you love them today!” He also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shared a picture of himself</a> in his hospital bed with the caption “GAMETIME!!!” and after the opening touchdown, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> “OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p><p>The NFL Players Association named Hamlin its Week 18 Community MVP following the millions of dollars that have been donated to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">his foundation’s GoFundMe page</a> this week.</p><h2>How else Hamlin was honored</h2><p>Numerous Bills players donned apparel bearing Hamlin’s No. 3 as they arrived at the game and the scoreboards at Highmark Stadium read “Love for Damar.” The “3″ in the on-field 30-yard line markers at the stadium were also outlined in blue as a tribute to Hamlin, and players had No. 3 patches on their game jerseys.</p><p>Players met at midfield after exiting the tunnel before the game to honor Hamlin. The public address announcer then called on everyone at the stadium to rise and show their support for Hamlin and his recovery before the singing of the national anthem. Buffalo’s medical and training staff was also honored before the game with a video salute on the scoreboard.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Inside Highmark Stadium right now <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Ued6oX5juf</a></p><p>— Joe Buscaglia (@JoeBuscaglia) <a href=#>January 8, 2023</a></p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wYgerS27Fg</a></p><p>— Joe Buscaglia (@JoeBuscaglia) <a href=#>January 8, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today is for 3.<a href=#>#LoveForDamar</a> | <a href=#>#ForDamar</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qTW7OKJHYa</a></p><p>— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) <a href=#>January 8, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>3 on our mind.<a href=#>#LoveForDamar</a> | <a href=#>#ForDamar</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4sInpA8j0D</a></p><p>— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) <a href=#>January 8, 2023</a></p><h2>Nightmare week ends with emotional win</h2><p>Exhale in relief, Bills fans. A grueling week ended with a cathartic victory that also knocked the Patriots out of the playoffs. Might as well make Bill Belichick miserable for the winter while putting on a show for Hamlin, who is still resting back at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Buffalo’s much-needed release began with an immediate eruption. Hines returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown, but the Bills didn’t cruise. Exhausted from a week of worrying whether Hamlin would survive the cardiac arrest that befell him Monday night, the Bills seemed to hit a wall as the first half wore on. The halftime score was tied.</p><p>The Patriots, a hollowed-out rival the Bills have thrashed three straight times, took a 17-13 lead midway through the third quarter. Then Hines struck again. He added a 101-yard kickoff return, and the Bills never looked back. By the end of the game, Allen was chucking the ball for fun, likely trying to help teammates reach contract incentives while blowing off more steam. — Graham</p><h2>No more true road games for Buffalo</h2><p>On an emotional day, the Bills used a full team effort to not only secure their 13th victory of the season, but also that they would not have to play a true road game for the rest of the season. As the second seed in the AFC playoffs, it’s either at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park or at a neutral site the rest of the way. Although the Bills made it a preseason goal to secure home-field advantage and a first-round bye, this result had to be a close second given all they’ve been through. — Buscaglia</p><h2>Defense shuts the door</h2><p>The Bills’ defense closed out the game with three second-half interceptions, capturing some of their early-season turnover success. It was led by three of their defensive stars in <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2AJ6oTJrxGnx7gDh href=#>Tre’Davious White</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZRj4di17FE6yBxBv href=#>Matt Milano</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=JKo3MELPaAeeJbLo href=#>Tremaine Edmunds</a>. And some of the Bills’ defenders felt that it wasn’t a coincidence that they wound up with three interceptions — the same as Hamlin’s jersey number. — Buscaglia</p><h2>Hines’ scores</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>CHILLS.</p><p>📺: <a href=#>@NFLonCBS</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9uXnx91reb</a></p><p>— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) <a href=#>January 8, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ARE YOU KIDDING, <a href=#>@TheNyNy7</a>?!</p><p>📺: <a href=#>@NFLonCBS</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZgH7YChSD8</a></p><p>— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) <a href=#>January 8, 2023</a></p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: Bryan M.
