Or are they just another example of fake news and misinformation?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Origin of the Death Hoax</strong></h3><p>The death hoax about TD Jakes seems to have originated from a YouTube video that was uploaded on September 26th 2022.

It said that he was rushed to the hospital but could not be revived. It also said that his wife, Serita Jakes, and his children were by his side when he passed away.</p><p>The video did not provide any source or evidence for its claims. It also had several grammatical and factual errors. For example, it said that TD Jakes was born in 1956, when in fact he was born in 1957. It also said that he had five children, when in fact he has six.</p><p>The video quickly went viral on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. Many people shared the video without verifying its authenticity. Some people expressed their shock and sadness over the news, while others questioned its validity.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Debunking of the Death Hoax</strong></h3><p>However, the rumor of TD Jakes’ death was soon debunked by several reputable sources and authorities.

And I want to thank you for being concerned about me! But please don’t believe everything you hear on social media!</p><p>He also urged his followers to be careful about what they share online and to check the facts before spreading rumors.</p><p>Secondly, several credible news outlets and websites also confirmed that TD Jakes was alive and well.
