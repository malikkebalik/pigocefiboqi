<time>24 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Riko Shibata is the wife of Nicholas Cage, the award-winning American actor and filmmaker. The Japanese-born actress is about 30 years younger than Cage and is the actor’s fifth wife. Her claim to fame is her marriage to the legendary Hollywood actor, as she was relatively unknown prior to their union.</strong></p><p>Shibata may be seeking a career in Hollywood as she was credited as the Mannequin woman in the 2021 movie, Prisoners of the Ghostland, in which her husband also starred. Her husband, Nicholas Cage, on the other hand, is one of the biggest names in the American film industry. He is an actor and filmmaker who is best known for featuring in movies like Face Off, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Mandy, Ghost Rider, and The Family Man.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Summary of Riko Shibata’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Riko Shibata</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Asian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Japanese</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Capricorn</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christian</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Riko Shibata’s Husband:</strong> Nicholas Cage</li><li><strong>Riko Shibata’s Children:</strong> Lennon Augie</li><li><strong>Riko Shibata’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 5 inches</li><li><strong>Riko Shibata’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 165 cm</li><li><strong>Riko Shibata’s Weight:</strong> 55 kg</li><li><strong>Riko Shibata’s Net Worth:</strong> Between $1 million – $2 million</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Nicholas Cage’s young wife</li><li><strong>Instagram:</strong> @animalriko</li></ul><h2><strong>Riko Shibata Was Born And Raised In Japan</strong></h2><p>Details about Riko Shibata’s age and childhood are not clear yet. There are reports that she was born on the 19th of April, while some others say she was born on the 10th of January. The exact year she was born is another source of confusion, as different media sources have varying information on that as well.</p><p>However, the fact that most of these sources agree that she is 30 years younger than her husband, Nicholas Cage, who was born January 7, 1964 (59 years), could mean that she was born in 1994.</p><p>We also know – with regard to her background – that Riko Shibata is of Asian ethnicity and was born and raised in Kyoto, Japan. For her education, the only information available to us is that she attended a university in Japan.</p><p>Her father is a businessman in Japan, and her mother is a homemaker. There are reports that she has siblings, but their names and identities have not been revealed to the media.</p><h2><strong>She Is An Entrepreneur</strong></h2><p>Details about what Riko Shibata does for a living are not clear. There are reports that she is an entrepreneur, and some say she is an entertainer. However, she most likely works in the entertainment industry since she was credited as the Mannequin woman for Prisoners of the Ghostland, and it was in the process of making the movie that she met the ‘A-list’ actor.</p><h2><strong>Riko Shibata And Nicolas Cage Met In 2020 and Got Married In 2021</strong></h2><p>Riko Shibata met Nicholas Cage back in 2020 in Shiga, Japan, where the latter had come for a movie. They met through a mutual friend, and later that year, paparazzi spotted them for the first time in New York City.</p><p>Nicholas Cage and Riko Shibata got married on the 16th of February, 2021, in a private wedding ceremony at the Wynn Hotel somewhere in Las Vegas.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Cage-Shibata-1.jpg alt="Riko Shibata" width=696 height=451 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In an interview with People, Cage’s representative told <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">People</a> that the wedding day was carefully chosen to honor the birthday of Cage’s late father. They had an interethnic marriage where the culture and beliefs of both parties were rightly represented. Riko Shibara wore a handmade Japanese Bridal Kimono that required three layers, and Cage was looking like a perfect gentleman in a Tom Ford Tuxedo.</p><p>The couple exchanged both traditional Catholic and Shinto vows. The poetry for the day was from Walt Whitman and Haiku. The wedding was small but glamorous, and after marriage, she took up her husband’s last name and is now known as Riko Cage.</p><h2><strong>The Actor’s Wife is 30 Years His Junior</strong></h2><p>The couple’s marriage to Riko has <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">raised many eyebrows</a>&nbsp;because of two reasons. The first reason has to do with Riko’s very young age – when compared to Cage’s – and the second reason is her race. Many of Nicholas Cage’s fans have a thing or two to say about it. The fact that he is more than double her age is head-scratching.</p><p>The murmurs are coming because Riko Shibata is even younger than Nicholas Cage’s first son, Weston Cage. Well, before proposing to Riko, Nicholas Cage knew all of these things, and she was also aware of their age difference when she said Yes to him. So, it seems they’re so engrossed in love that they don’t actually care. Neither of them has addressed these murmurs so far.</p><h2><strong>Riko Shibata Is Cage’s Fifth Wife</strong></h2><p>Nicholas Cage has had quite a checkered history when it comes to marriage, as he has been married five times in the past. He was first married to fellow actor Patricia Arquette in April 1995, and after six years, they divorced in 2001, citing irreconcilable differences as their reason for breaking up.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Riko-Shibata-profile-1.jpg alt="Riko Shibata" width=696 height=454 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>He then walked down the aisle a second time with Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of the rock legend Elvis Presley, on the 10th of August 2002, but after 107 days, they were divorced. Alive Kim and Cage exchanged marital vows in 2004 and welcomed their son, Kal-El, the following year. However, they later split after 12 years of marriage.</p><p>In 2019, Cage was very briefly married to Erika Koike, who he also wed in Las Vegas. Four days after the ceremony, the actor filed for an annulment, and only two months later, he was granted a divorce.</p><h2><strong>Riko Shibata And Nicholas Cage Are Having A Baby</strong></h2><p>Nicholas Cage <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">revealed that he would be having a baby girl</a> with his new wife on the popular Kelly Clarkson Show. The actor and director was brimming with joy and excitement to be a parent to another child. This child is expected to be his first daughter, and it makes him so happy.</p><p>Cage also revealed that his daughter will be called Lennon Augie. This name was chosen to pay tribute to his late father, August ‘Augie’ Coppola, and the late John Lennon. This will be Cage’s third child as he already has two sons – Kal-El, with ex-wife Alice Kim and Weston, with former partner Christina Fulton.</p><h2><strong>Fans Notice Changes in Riko’s Dentition</strong></h2><p>Fans of Nicholas Cage noticed that Riko Shibata’s teeth used to have gaps, but in her recent pictures, the gaps are no longer there, and her dental arrangement looks better. They are suggesting that she may have gotten an alternative to braces called Invisalign. However, neither Cage nor Riko has confirmed these rumors.</p><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions About Riko Shibata</strong></h2><h3><strong>What Is Riko’s Age Compared to Nicholas’s?</strong></h3><p>While we cannot exactly say what her age is, Riko Shibata is about 30 years younger than Nicholas Cage, who is 59 years old.
