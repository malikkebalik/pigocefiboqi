<time>16 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Mike Wolfe&nbsp;finally moved into his dream house in 2012. His humble abode wouldn’t be considered humble if one were to take a tour of his lair. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The 53-year-old is renowned for creating and co-hosting the reality TV show American Pickers -- a show centered around pickers who go from town to town looking for antiques and collectibles. He’s also an ambassador of the Operation Smile project, appearing on its awareness programmes from time to time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In addition to making appearances on his show every year (alongside <a href=# rel=follow>Frank Fritz</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>Danielle Colby</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>Danny Koker</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>Robbie Wolfe</a>), the Joliet native currently runs an antique and apparel company Antique Archaeology.</p><h3><strong>Mike Wolfe's Bio: He Had Rough Upbringing</strong></h3><p>The famed picker was born in 1964 in Joliet, Illinois in a single parent household. He’s the middle child of three children raised by a single mother. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Poverty permeated throughout his childhood. Later, his family moved to Iowa where he met his future co-host, Frank Fritz while attending high-school. In 1982, both of them graduated from Bettendorf High School.</p><p></p><p>Young Mike lets out crooked smile for photo-op (Photo: fetchsport.com) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As a 6-year-old, he made his first pick. The profit from his very first transaction was $5. A decade later, he pocketed $4,950 in profit after he bought an abandoned bike from a farmer for $50.</p><h3><strong>American Pickers' Story: History Channel Picks His Picking Skills</strong></h3><p>Mike spent almost two decades specializing in ‘picking’ before his show was finally picked by History Channel. The executives at History Channel were so impressed by Mike that they broke the protocol of airing a pilot and handed Mike and <a href=# rel=follow>his longtime friend and co-host, Frank</a>&nbsp;a season deal.</p><p>Upon its release, American Pickers delivered History Channel’s biggest first-week audience since Ice Road Truckers&nbsp;(2007). In 2018,&nbsp;American Pickers is in its 19th season and remains one of History Channel’s biggest shows to date. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He has also published two books highlighting picking skills: Kid Pickers: How To Turn Jack Into Treasure; and Art Of The Pick.</p><h3><strong>Mike Wolfe's Net Worth 2018 Amidst Conflicting Reports</strong></h3><p>If we were to believe the reports, the reality TV star makes an astounding half a million dollars in salary for a season-long excursion at History Channel’s American Pickers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Mike and his high school bud, Frank, are reportedly paid $125,000 for first two episode of a season and a humbling sum of $20,000 per episode for the remainder of the season.&nbsp;Unless his actual tax filing is released, speculating his net worth will be a game for Tabloids. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for his net worth, he has assembled an empire valued at 13 million dollars. However, there have been various other reports of his net worth in 2018&nbsp;contesting the figures mentioned above.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3><strong>Ranking His Net Worth Among Other American Pickers</strong></h3><p>Mike's colleague, Frank Fritz, is believed to have <a href=# rel=follow>an estimated net worth of 5 million US dollars</a>, which is 8 million less than him. However, he is still following the in-house automobile expert of the show, Danny Koker, who has <a href=# rel=follow>an estimated net worth of $23 million</a>. However, Mike is <a href=# rel=follow>richer than his brother, Robie Wolfe, </a>regarding earnings and net worth. He also beats another American Picker, <a href=# rel=follow>Danielle Colby</a>, who net worth is <a href=# rel=follow>estimated to be between $1.5 million to $2 million</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Mike Married His Wife In&nbsp;Fantasy Wedding</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Mike got married to <a href=# rel=follow>Jodie Faeth on 8 September 2012</a> in Leiper's Fork Tennessee. It was a playful wedding themed as ‘Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?’ <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They had dated for ten years before tying the knot. Mike also fathers a daughter, Charlie and a son, Kyle from Jodie’s previous marriage.</p><p>With the money he has made selling his way of life on TV, the Bettendorf alumni have been able to buy his dream house to accommodate his family.</p><h2><strong>House Of His Dreams Is Luxury Personified</strong></h2><p>Believe it or not, Mike Wolf bought his first home at an auction while he was motorcycle shopping. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A year before their wedding in September 2011, they were living in downtown, LeClaire, Iowa by the river. They had rented the ground floor to retail businesses while the duplex apartment above was their home -- a neat space, unlike what one would expect given his earnings.</p><p>The house he currently occupies is a complete opposite of the modest abode he flaunted to an NY Times reporter in 2011. After their wedding in 2012, he moved his family to a new dream house.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Spread over 32-acres-of-woodland, his dream house is 5,100 square feet. Upon entering his estate, one can’t help but notice the 18th-century gate and front door. Inside, there lays his collection of over 40 motorcycles and a built-in telephone booth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p><strong>Related:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Wolf Blitzer's Salary And Net Worth </a><a href=# rel=follow>Is</a><a href=# rel=follow> Massive!
