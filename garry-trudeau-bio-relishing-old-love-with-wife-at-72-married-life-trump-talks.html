(Published on 5 August 2016) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Garry&nbsp;won a&nbsp;Pulitzer Prize for the cartoon in 1975 and was also nominated for an Oscar in the&nbsp;category of Animated Short Film.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Garry Trudeau's Bio: Early Life & Illustrating Career</strong></h3><p>69-year-old Garry&nbsp;Trudeau&nbsp;was born as Garretson Beekman Trudeau on&nbsp;21st July 1948 in the city of New York, USA. He is the son&nbsp;of&nbsp;Jean Douglas and&nbsp;Francis Berger Trudeau, Jr. and the great-grandson of&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp;Edward Livingston Trudeau, the person who created&nbsp;Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium&nbsp;at&nbsp;Saranac Lake, New York for the treatment of&nbsp;pulmonary tuberculosis.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As for siblings, Garry is the&nbsp;brother&nbsp;of journalist, Michelle Trudeau. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Geoff Tracy Biography: Age, Wife And Family To Net worth Of Restaurant Owner</a></p><p>Garry attended the St.Paul's school in Concord, Hampshire and later earned a Master Of Fine Arts in graphic design from the Yale School of Art. He spent much of his time&nbsp;cartooning and writing for the nation's oldest&nbsp;humor magazine,&nbsp;The Yale Record.&nbsp;Later, he became the&nbsp;editor-in-chief of the magazine and worked there.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, in 1970 Garry&nbsp;launched his own comic strip "Doonesbury" and amassed huge acclamation. His strip&nbsp;slowly started garnering attention, and more than 1400 magazines, worldwide syndicated his cartoon. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Later in 2013, Garry wrote and produced a political sitcom, called Alpha House. Republican senators such as John Goodman and Bill Murray&nbsp;starred in the series that was first aired in April 2013. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3><strong>Garry's Satirism&nbsp;In His Comics For Donald Trump</strong></h3><p>While speeding his career in the cartoon world, Garry&nbsp;works on his strip "Doonesbury" for syndicated newspapers to satire on the leading politicians and editors. Garry even doesn't hesitate to share out his opinion regarding&nbsp;President&nbsp;Donald Trump via his cartoons.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Moreover, Garry, who had jokingly&nbsp;predicted Donald Trump to be the president in&nbsp;1987, even authored a book naming it as,&nbsp;Yuge!&nbsp;30 Years of Doonesbury on&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;which was&nbsp;published back on 5th July 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about the book during an interview with the USA TODAY on 14 July 2016, Garry said that the thing he doesn't like about Trump is his cynicism. He&nbsp;quoted that the most prominent con of&nbsp;Trump is that he doesn't know how to respect civilians and love people who support him.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Moreover, Garry wrote and produced satirical&nbsp;comedy titled&nbsp;Alfa House and&nbsp;Tanner '88. He was&nbsp;nominated for an Oscar&nbsp;in the category of Animated short film in 1977 for his work on&nbsp;A Doonesbury Special and later, the film won the Cannes Film Festival Jury Special Prize in 1978. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>With his dedication in his craft, Garry's total net worth, as of now, is estimated to be $40 million, which is equal to the net worth of his wife,&nbsp;Jane.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Garry Releases Sequel To His Bestselling Book</strong></h3><p>It was on 18 September 2018 that Garry released his new book, #SAD!: Doonesbury in the Time of Trump, as a sequel to his 2016 bestseller, Yuge!: 30 Years of Doonesbury on Trump.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>His new book is a tragic comedy collection of the first 500 days of Trump's presidency. Despite the fact that Donald Trump has called Garry a third-rate cartoonist, it doesn't help but motivate Garry to throw in more satires on Trump.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In the preface to Garry's new book, he brings up the old Finley Dunne adage about journalism advocacy, how it should afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A satiric tactic that Garry finds particularly fruitful in the mimicking of Donald Trump's tweets and the quite possible challenge of trying to think like the White House and finding the positive spin of words that are indefensible and comedy haiku.</p><p>Garry aims at citizens rising every morning in bracing for randomly capitalized, horribly spelled toxic tweeting from the Oval Office, He has given them a tweak at&nbsp;a few hours of not so fitful sleep with his new book.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><strong>Lives In Lavish Mansion At Rockland County</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Garry married the CNN journalist Jane Pauley at the age of 32&nbsp;on 14th June 1980. They together are parents to their three children. Their first twin,&nbsp;Ross, and Rachel were born in&nbsp;1983, while their third child&nbsp;Thomas was born in the year 1986.</p><p><strong>You Don't Want To Miss:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Is Graham Bensinger Gay?
