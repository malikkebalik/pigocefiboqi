Information on the Aukus defence pact – which Australia signed with the UK and US – was of particular interest, he added.</p><p>But the former Australian politician was the most notable individual the foreign ring had “successfully cultivated and recruited”, he claimed, while offering no specific details on the years they were active.</p><p>“This politician sold out their country, party and former colleagues to advance the interests of the foreign regime,” Mr Burgess said.</p><p>“At one point, the former politician even proposed bringing a prime minister’s family member into the spies’ orbit.</p><p>“Fortunately, that plot did not go ahead but other schemes did.”</p><p>The former politician is no longer working with the group, he said, adding that Australian intelligence officials had disbanded its operations and helped “unaware” participants extract themselves.</p><p>“Several individuals should be grateful the espionage and foreign interference laws are not retrospective,” Mr Burgess said, referring to tougher laws which passed the country’s parliament in 2018.</p><p>His agency confronted the A-team directly late last year, and has now decided to blow their cover to warn Australians.</p><p>“Australians need to know that the threat is real. The threat is now. And the threat is deeper and broader than you might think,” he said.</p><p>Mr Burgess has recently spoken of the danger posed to Australia by Chinese espionage, and last year he revealed his agency had broken up a “hive” of spies, which local media later identified as being Russian operatives.</p><p>Former treasurer and ex-ambassador to the US Joe Hockey was among those calling for the MP to be identified, on the basis that not doing so would “besmirch” all politicians.</p><p>“The former politician is a traitor… somehow they’re allowed to walk off into the sunset without having their name or reputation revealed, and that is absurd,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p><p>Key government ministers have also expressed dismay over the allegations but backed Mr Burgess’ decision not to identify the individual.</p><p>“He wouldn’t have done it this way if he didn’t think it was necessary to do it this way,” Treasurer Jim Chalmers said.</p><p>By BBC News</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57xaippp2iYq62v9OrmKWhkaN6sbvLoquim5mWu26uxJyYpp1dm7yzscigpWaZl5q7tXnNmquip56oerS82GaZqKujYsCixdJo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fformer-australian-politician-became-foreign-agent-nation-s-spy-boss-says.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fformer-australian-politician-became-foreign-agent-nation-s-spy-boss-says.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fformer-australian-politician-became-foreign-agent-nation-s-spy-boss-says.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fformer-australian-politician-became-foreign-agent-nation-s-spy-boss-says.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fformer-australian-politician-became-foreign-agent-nation-s-spy-boss-says.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fformer-australian-politician-became-foreign-agent-nation-s-spy-boss-says.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gwamnatin-sokoto-ta-yiwa-malaman-musulunci-kyauta-ana-kukan-tsadar-ragon-layya.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gwamnatin-sokoto-ta-yiwa-malaman-musulunci-kyauta-ana-kukan-tsadar-ragon-layya.html>Gwamnatin Sokoto Ta Yiwa Malaman Musulunci Kyauta Ana Kukan Tsadar Ragon Layya</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eric-blaszczyk-death-tampa-shooting-of-37-year-old-man.html>Eric Blaszczyk Death | Tampa Shooting Of 37 Year Old Man</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eric-blaszczyk-death-tampa-shooting-of-37-year-old-man.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
