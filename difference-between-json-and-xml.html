This is where JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) come into play. Both of these formats are used to store and exchange data, but there are some key differences between them. In this article, we will take a look at how JSON and XML differ from one another and what makes them unique.</p><h2><span id=Overview_of_JSON_and_XML>Overview of JSON and XML</span></h2><p>JSON is a data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data between applications. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and is much easier to read and write than XML. JSON is also more lightweight than XML and is self-describing, which makes it a great choice for mobile applications and web services.</p><p>XML is a markup language that is used to store and exchange data. It is based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and is much more verbose than JSON. XML is also more complex and difficult to read and write than JSON, but it offers more features such as namespaces and validation.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Syntax>Difference in Syntax</span></h2><p>The syntax of JSON and XML is one of the main differences between the two. JSON uses key-value pairs that are separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces. XML, on the other hand, uses tags to define elements and their content. XML also has a more rigid structure than JSON, which means that it is more difficult to read and write.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Data_Types>Difference in Data Types</span></h2><p>JSON and XML also differ in the way they handle data types. JSON supports only strings, numbers, booleans, and null values, while XML supports a wider range of data types such as dates, times, and even binary data. This makes XML a better choice for applications that need to store complex data types.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Validation>Difference in Validation</span></h2><p>JSON does not support any type of validation, while XML does. This means that XML documents can be validated against a schema to ensure that they are valid before they are sent across the network. This ensures that data sent between applications is valid and can be trusted.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Extensibility>Difference in Extensibility</span></h2><p>JSON and XML also differ in the way they are extended. JSON does not have a way to extend the format, while XML allows for the use of namespaces and custom tags. This makes XML a better choice for applications that need to extend the format in order to store additional data.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Performance>Difference in Performance</span></h2><p>JSON is faster than XML as it is more lightweight and does not require the same level of parsing. This makes it a better choice for applications that need to process large amounts of data quickly.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Security>Difference in Security</span></h2><p>JSON does not support any type of encryption or authentication, while XML does. This makes XML a better choice for applications that need to send sensitive data over the network.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Human_Readability>Difference in Human Readability</span></h2><p>JSON is much easier to read than XML as it is more concise and does not require the same level of parsing. This makes it a better choice for applications that need to be easily understood by humans.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Searchability>Difference in Searchability</span></h2><p>JSON does not support any type of search, while XML does. This makes XML a better choice for applications that need to search through large amounts of data quickly.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Compression>Difference in Compression</span></h2><p>JSON does not support any type of compression, while XML does. This makes XML a better choice for applications that need to reduce the size of data before it is sent over the network.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Data_Modeling>Difference in Data Modeling</span></h2><p>JSON is better suited for data modeling as it is more flexible and does not require the same level of structure as XML. This makes it a better choice for applications that need to model complex data.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Scalability>Difference in Scalability</span></h2><p>JSON is more scalable than XML as it is more lightweight and does not require the same level of parsing. This makes it a better choice for applications that need to scale quickly and efficiently.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Parsing>Difference in Parsing</span></h2><p>JSON is much easier to parse than XML as it is more concise and does not require the same level of complexity. This makes it a better choice for applications that need to parse large amounts of data quickly.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Versioning>Difference in Versioning</span></h2><p>JSON does not support any type of versioning, while XML does. This makes XML a better choice for applications that need to keep track of changes over time.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Error_Handling>Difference in Error Handling</span></h2><p>JSON does not support any type of error handling, while XML does. This makes XML a better choice for applications that need to handle errors gracefully.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Compatibility>Difference in Compatibility</span></h2><p>JSON is more compatible with other languages and technologies than XML as it is more lightweight and does not require the same level of complexity. This makes it a better choice for applications that need to be compatible with a wide range of systems.</p><h2><span id=Difference_in_Maintenance>Difference in Maintenance</span></h2><p>JSON is much easier to maintain than XML as it is more concise and does not require the same level of complexity. This makes it a better choice for applications that need to be maintained over time.</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>JSON and XML are both used to store and exchange data, but they have some key differences. JSON is easier to read and write than XML and is more lightweight, while XML offers more features such as namespaces and validation. The choice of which format to use depends on the application’s requirements and the type of data being stored and exchanged.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCwyJ%2BdnqqVo7CmecGeq7CdlaN6q7%2FOp2SappRixa64jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdifference-between-json-and-xml.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdifference-between-json-and-xml.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdifference-between-json-and-xml.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdifference-between-json-and-xml.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdifference-between-json-and-xml.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdifference-between-json-and-xml.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./discovering-lydia-in-you-are-so-not-invited-to-my-bat-mitzvah-release-date-storyline-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./discovering-lydia-in-you-are-so-not-invited-to-my-bat-mitzvah-release-date-storyline-and-more.html>Discovering Lydia in You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah: Release Date, Storyline, and More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chita-rivera-her-ethnicity-religion-and-family.html>Chita Rivera: Her Ethnicity, Religion, and Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chita-rivera-her-ethnicity-religion-and-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
