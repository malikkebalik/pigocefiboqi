On Friday, January 17th. Too many people like him and care about him. His career was closely tied to the Charlotte Hornets, and he has many fans all over the world. Their fans want to know what happened to him and why he died. So let’s talk briefly about what happened to him and why he died.</p><p>Kelly Vaillancourt, Gerry Vaillancourt’s daughter, said that her father died because of a heart disease that he had known about 25 years ago. Kelly Sia said in an interview on Sunday that we never thought he would live more than 25 years after the disease was found. He never did anything that the book said he should do. “You never knew what you were going to do with him every day, but you always knew it would be fun.” He worked in the Charlotte media market for many years, starting in the late 1980s, when the real Charlotte Hornets were born.</p><figure id=attachment_20496 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-20496 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Gerry Vaillancourt</figure><h2>What happened to Gerry Vaillancourt?</h2><p>From 1990 to 2002, he ran the TV and radio broadcasts for the Hornets and also hosted sports talk radio shows on other local stations. Vaillancourt has two daughters, Kelly Vaillancourt and Shannon Vaillancourt D’Alton, as well as two sisters and too many grandchildren to count. In 2017, he comes back to Charlotte to host a radio show on ESPN 730 after being gone for a long time. He said on social media that his contract will end when he leaves ESPN 730 after more than two years and radio after more than 30 years.</p><p>Jim Szoke, a longtime coworker and friend of WBT and Charlotte Hornets radio broadcasts, said, “When sports talk in Charlotte first started, Gerry was one of the realities. He was funny, entertaining, and knew everything there was to know about basketball. I liked it when Hubie Brown came as a regular guest and listened to them talk about basketball in detail. In a statement about his death released Sunday, the Hornets say that they are sad to hear about Gerry Vaillancourt’s death. We will miss his analysis a lot, and we want his family, friends, and coworkers to know how much we care.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;What Caused Comedian Raju Srivastav Death?

For us, he was all of those things and more,” a WZGV representative said in a social media post on Sunday.</p><p>Coworkers thought of Vaillancourt as a reliable broadcaster who was always happy to share his vast sports knowledge with listeners.</p><p>Jim Szoke, who works at radio station WBT (1110 AM, 99.3 FM), said in an interview that Gerry was one of the first people to do sports talk in Charlotte.

We worked together for about two years, from 2014 to 2016. Those were my last two years in radio. During those few years, Gerry and I worked together for hours every day to try to build an audience and make a show that was watched by more than just a few people on the edge. He had no fear. He was insistent. He was kind. The years I worked with Gerry were the best years of my career and the most satisfying years of my life. Gerry was a big man and one of the best people I knew.</p><p>Mike Scott wrote, “I was saddened to hear about the death of the one and only Gerry Vaillancourt today. He was the voice of the Charlotte Hornets (and the team before it became the New Orleans Pelicans), a TV and radio personality in New Orleans, and a great person all around. He was funny, silly, and knew how to wear a hat well. Big guy, I miss you and love you.”</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;How Did Pathologist Joseph Sonnier Die?
