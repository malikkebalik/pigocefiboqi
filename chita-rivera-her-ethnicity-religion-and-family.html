However, she is Roman Catholic. Rivera is a prominent American actress, dancer, and singer, widely recognized as one of the most iconic figures in the history of American musical theater.

She practices Roman Catholicism. In 1957, she married Tony Mordente, a fellow West Side Story dancer.

Rivera and Mordente separated in 1966, and she has maintained her religious beliefs and practices despite her busy career in the entertainment industry.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chita-Rivera-1.jpg alt="Chita Rivera" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Throughout her career, Rivera has received numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and two Tony Awards for Best Leading Actress in a Musical.
