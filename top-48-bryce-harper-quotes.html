You’re comfortable here; hit from there.’”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“Spirituality is something that makes you who you are on and off the field. It’s something you try and live by.

I think that’s huge with a lot of baseball writers and old school guys. Of course, that’s not the main goal – the main goal is winning a World Series. Hall of Fame is so far away.

I’m pretty respectful to the media.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“I think you have to be respectful to the people who want to talk to you.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“I went to school, but nobody really noticed me.

That first knock of the game, you are going on kickoff, and you are just trying to smack somebody just as hard as you can. That’s how I play baseball. I want to hit you.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“There’s nobody as sexy as Robinson Cano in the box. I had a coach, Chris Sheff, who always told me to be as sexy as you can in the box.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“It’s not like I’m out eating McDonald’s and Del Taco every night.
