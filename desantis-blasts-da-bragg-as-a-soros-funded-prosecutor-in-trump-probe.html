Ron DeSantis on Monday blasted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as a “Soros-funded prosecutor” in his first public remarks about former President Donald Trump’s <a href=#>claim that he will be arrested</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p>DeSantis, a likely main rival to Trump as he seeks the 2024 Republican nomination, also provoked Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign by saying he wouldn’t get involved in “any way” in the case.</p><p>Addressing Trump’s claim of an indictment, DeSantis said he has only seen the “rumors swirl” but no&nbsp;facts, “so I don’t know what’s going to happen.”&nbsp;</p><p>“But I do know this: The Manhattan district attorney is a [George] <a href=#>Soros-funded prosecutor, </a>and so he, like other Soros-funded prosecutors, they weaponize their office to <a href=#>impose a political agenda</a> on society at the expense of the rule of law and public safety,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DeSantis told reporters</a> during a news conference on Monday.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis unloaded on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on Monday over his investigation into Donald Trump. <span class=credit>Twitter/@GovRonDeSantis</span></figure><p>The governor ripped Bragg for downgrading half of the felonies to misdemeanors and putting&nbsp;the lives of New Yorkers at risk.&nbsp;</p><p>“He says he doesn’t want to even have jail time for the vast, vast majority of crimes. And what we’ve seen in Manhattan is we’ve seen the crime rate go up, and we’ve seen citizens become less safe,” DeSantis said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He said Bragg and other Soros-backed district attorneys are a “menace to society” for ignoring crime while coddling criminals, “and that hurts a lot of people every single day.”</p><p>He went on to say he would not get involved in the case, including extradition against Trump, a fellow Floridian.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Gov. Ron DeSantis called Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg a “Soros-funded prosecutor.” <span class=credit>Matthew McDermott</span></figure><p>“I have no interest in getting involved in some type of manufactured circus by some Soros DA. He’s trying to do a political spectacle. He’s trying to virtue signal for his base. I’ve got real issues I got to deal with here in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said.&nbsp;</p><p>​Trump’s&nbsp;​Make America Great Again ​campaign​ put out a statement Monday afternoon to respond to DeSantis’ comments, saying, “Ron is wrong.”​</p><p>​”This is a real issue,” the statement said, adding that DeSantis “doesn’t think that the weaponization of our legal system is a&nbsp;​’​real issue.​'”​</p><p>“​Democrats abusing the justice system to target Republicans is a real issue that impacts all Americans. Our country won’t survive if the courts are weaponized to imprison political opponents​,” the statement said.​</p><p>The campaign also called attention to a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> tweet from Donald Trump Jr. ​</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels pose for a picture in 2006. <span class=credit>Stormy Daniels</span></figure><p>“​So DeSantis thinks that Dems weaponizing the law to indict President Trump is a ‘manufactured circus’ & isn’t a ‘real issue.’ Pure weakness. Now we know why he was silent all weekend. He’s totally owned by Karl Rove, Paul Ryan & his billionaire donors. 100% Controlled Opposition​,” Trump Jr. said.&nbsp;</p><p>During his news conference, DeSantis also threw shade on the former commander-in-chief&nbsp;over the alleged hush money payment that may land him behind bars.</p><p>“I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair. I just, I can’t speak to that,” he said, drawing a laugh from the audience.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump hit back at the Sunshine State’s governor by slinging mud, insinuating without evidence that DeSantis may have “partied with underage girls.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Ron DeSanctimonious will probably find out about FALSE ACCUSATIONS & FAKE STORIES sometime in the future, as he gets older, wiser, and better known, when he’s unfairly and illegally attacked by a woman, even classmates that are “underage” (or possibly a man!). I’m sure he will want to fight these misfits just like I do!” Trump <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a Truth Social post</a> on Monday.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Former President Donald Trump says he will be indicted by the Manhattan district attorney on Tuesday over a 2016 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The former president shared the message with an image purportedly of DeSantis with three young-looking women, one of them with a drink in hand.&nbsp;</p><p>“Ron DeSantis partied with underage girls at drinking party while teaching at Georgia school,” a caption above the image read.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no evidence to support the wild claim or the veracity of the photograph shared by the former president.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The elder Trump, in a series of postings </a>on his Truth Social messaging platform over the weekend, said he was going to be arrested on Tuesday by Bragg over an alleged<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy<strong> </strong>Daniels </a>before the 2016 election.</p><p>“THE FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE & FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.
