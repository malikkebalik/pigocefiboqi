<time>03 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Devising a fool-proof methodology to actualize their ideas, BBC Two’s ‘Million Pound Menu’ follows twelve budding restaurateurs trying to win over investors. With no more than three days, the aspiring chefs have to showcase their talent and penchant for running a lucrative business in order to win over considerable investment. Released in 2018, season 1 of the <a href=#>culinary show</a> features an array of talent ranging from junk vegan food to cookie dough. Years since it first came on air, fans are curious to know how the businesses of the restaurateurs have taken shape. So, if you’re also wondering more about the <a href=#>reality</a>&nbsp;stars, look no further because we’ve got all the information right here!</p><h2>Ruth Hansom and Emily Lambert’s Career Path Beyond Epoch</h2><p>Enchanting investor and two-time Michelin-starred chef Atul Kochhar, Ruth and Emily had successfully secured an investment of 1 million pounds to start their very own restaurant. Aimed at fine dining, Ruth and Emily had left their jobs behind to kickstart their journey as restaurateurs. While Ruth brought her expertise as a chef to the table, Emily’s capabilities as a sommelier almost led them to establish Epoch. However, the duo ultimately realized they wanted different things. Ruth went back to scale her capabilities in the kitchen and earned her first head chef position at the Luton Hoo Hotel.</p><p>Next, she took the lead as head chef at Notting Hill’s Pomona’s. After working at The Princess of Shoreditch, a gastropub in East London, Ruth is now heading the team at Swinton Estate in Yorkshire. Apart from work, the chef also enjoys exploring new places with her husband and dog. Ruth has also appeared on ‘Great British Menu.’ After exiting the show, Emily continued her work at The Ritz as a sommelier. In 2019, Emily also worked at Coravin as a brand and business development executive. Shortly after, Emily established Loxwood Meadworks, along with her husband Danny Bacon, where the duo sells mead. Apart from selling honey wine, Emily is also an Instagram creator.</p><h2>Ewan Hutchison Revitalizing Shimpwreck Now</h2><p>After walking away from the show with no investments and only an offer for mentorship by Scott Collins, the 28-year-old entrepreneur didn’t deter and ultimately prolonged his dream of opening a fast-food casual restaurant in Scotland. Before coming on the show, the reality star had secured a loan from his parents to open up a food stall. Ewan had specialized in king prawn tempura buns, fish finger sandwiches, and sweet potato fries. Later, Ewan’s venture also won several Street Food awards. After failing to launch Shimpwreck as the next big casual dining brand, Ewan continued to operate through a street stall.</p><p>In 2021, disaster struck when his food shack was <a href=#>robbed</a>. The establishment had accrued losses of over 2000 pounds but subsequently bounced back. Now, Ewan continues to head his kitchen as Director and hopes to turn his venture into something more eventually. Moreover, with encouragement from the local community, Ewan and his team have continued to scale their operations. Based in Edinburgh, Ewan continues to enjoy life with his partner Tara Weeraratna and their dog.</p><h2>Oil, Joe, and Michael Developing FINCA Now</h2><p>Having secured £150,000 for a Cuban-inspired street food restaurant in Liverpool from investor Jeremy Roberts, the trio went on to ensure different residencies over time. Oil, Joe, and Michael held a pop-up at Artisan, a Manchester-based restaurant, for quite a while. Not just this, the trio also presented their food at several events across Liverpool. The group also popped up at Spinningfields for a while. After FINCA materialized as a Liverpool-based restaurant, the trio continued to accelerate personally and professionally. Michael is now the Head Chef at Buyers Club and the Co-Founder of Cahita. Oil likes to keep his information under wraps, and Joe continues to head FINCA as Director and Co-Founder. Readers and fans can find the establishment at 46 Duke Street, Liverpool, UK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1516934237413.jpg><h2>Chelsea Campbell Expanding Wholesome Junkies Today</h2><p>While Chelsea failed to secure £95,000 to open a vegan junk food restaurant in Machester, the reality star still walked away with a determination to succeed.

Eventually, the duo explored different paths after realizing they weren’t ready to commit to the idea fully.</p><p>Moreover, since Hollings was on paper, Ronnie and James did not have much to lose. Ronnie continued his role at Peckham Manor as Chef Owner. Since then, he has appeared on ‘Great British Menu,’ and ‘Sunday Brunch.’ He is also a private chef, event caterer, and consultant for renowned establishments in London.

From holding pop-ups at Battersea Power Station to conducting events, Graham continued to exponentiate his business’ growth.

While the duo had initially attained success in producing high-quality Thai food and grew their business exponentially, they ultimately had to step down from their vegan, plant-based restaurant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/p0687sd3.jpg><p>In 2022, Lee and Faai decided to step away from the operations completely and ultimately sold the business.

Nevertheless, the duo is still accelerating in their careers individually. Lee is currently a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Southern California. Faai has since returned to Bangkok and enjoys life with her mother and brother while discovering new opportunities.</p><h2>Prince Owusu Elevating Trap Kitchen</h2><p>While the haute cuisine Prince Cofie Owusu served didn’t pique the interest of the investors, the entrepreneur still managed to achieve several milestones.
