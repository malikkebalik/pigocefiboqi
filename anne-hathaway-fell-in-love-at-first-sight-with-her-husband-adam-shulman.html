However, many people swear by it and believe it happens.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>One such person is the acclaimed actress <a href=# rel=follow>Anne Hathaway</a>. She fell in love with her husband, Adam Shulman, at first glance and knew that he was the one for her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The two usually keep their relationship under wraps. Regardless, they often attend events together and talk about their spouse in interviews â€” giving people a sneak peek into their life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The pair has been happily married for&nbsp;a decade and shares two children. But things were not always rainbows and butterflies for them.</p><h2>How Anne Hathaway and Her Husband Met</h2><p>Hathaway knew from the moment her eyes met Shulman that she had met the love of her life.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The two were introduced to each other through a mutual friend at the Palm Springs Film Festival in 2008 and instantly connected. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She knew she would marry Shulman and told her friend about it, which she later revealed to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Harper's Bazaar UK</a> in 2013.&nbsp;However, that year was not a great time for Hathaway. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The actress was going through a very public breakup. She had just parted ways with her then-boyfriend, Raffaello Follieri.</p><p>Follieri had earlier been arrested for cases of defrauding. He was&nbsp;sentenced to four years in prison for defrauding people, including priests, of millions of dollars. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As a result, Hathaway had trust issues regarding relationships and said, "I also knew that I couldn't have met him at a worse time."</p><p>But things unraveled like the&nbsp;famous saying: if it is meant to be, it will be.&nbsp;Despite the scandal and heartache, The Princess Diaries star trusted her instinct, took the leap, and dated Shulman.</p><p>It was admittedly a&nbsp;scary experience, but being with Shulman helped take her fears away. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Anne Hathaway has been together with her husband, Adam Shulman, for over a decade, and the duo shares two children. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She learned to trust him and admittedly became a better version of herself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>After dating for four years, the two tied the knot in September 2012 in a very low-key setting at the Big Sur on the California coast.</p><p>The private <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wedding ceremony</a>&nbsp;had around 150 guests, and the couple exchanged their "I Dos" in front of them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Anne Hathaway and Adam Shulman's Children</h2><p>As said before, Hathaway shares two children with her husband.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Ever since they were married, the actress talked about wanting to have children to start a family with her husband. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her wishes came true&nbsp;when she got&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pregnant</a> with her first child around three years later.</p><p>On January 4, 2016, she confirmed her pregnancy via Instagram after <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posting a picture</a> of herself, flaunting her baby bump.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The pair were blessed with their first son, Johathan, on March 24, 2016.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In June 2019, The Dark Knight Rises actress again took to Instagram to announce she was expecting.</p><p>While doing so, she opened up about her infertility and showed her support to those going through the same as her. Their son, Jack, was born in November 2019.</p><p>There are high chances that Hathaway and her husband will welcome more children in the future. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While appearing on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> in October 2020, the actress confessed she does not know about her family's future.</p><p>As per her accounts, the pair want&nbsp;more children sometimes, and sometimes they don't.
