Although Hilary Quinlan prefers to keep details about her relationship private, she and Gumbel met several years ago in Chicago. At the time, Hilary was working at an investment banking organization.</p><p>Hilary Quinlan got married to Bryant after his 28-year-old marriage to June Barranco came crashing. He was accused of infidelity and having an affair with Hilary while still married to his ex-wife. Meanwhile, Hilary and Bryant got engaged in 2001, but their wedding happened a year after their engagement.</p><p>In August 2002, they tied the knot at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, United States. Rather than being lavish as per their status, they instead opted for a more intimate and private ceremony. Their wedding, which had a total of 25 guests, had just their family and close friends in attendance.</p><h2><strong>Does Hilary Quinlan Have Kids With Bryant Gumbel?</strong></h2><p>Hilary Quinlan and Bryant Gumbel do not have any kids together despite being married for 21 years now. However, Bryant Gumbel had two children from his previous marriage to June, a son called Bradley Christopher Gumbel and a daughter Jillian Beth Gumbel. Since Hilary Quinlan became Bryant’s wife, she also became a stepmother to his children from his previous marriage. Below is a peek at the author’s stepchildren.</p><h3><strong>Bradley Christopher Gumbel</strong></h3><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bradley Christopher Gumbel</a> is the first child that Bryant Gumbel welcomed with his ex-wife, June Barranco. He was born in 1987 in the United States, but his exact place of birth was not revealed. Bradley Christopher Gumbel only rose to fame as the son of Bryant Gumbel.</p><p>He has also made headlines for his run-ins with law enforcement. It was reported in August 2002 that the then-22-year-old Bradley was accused of robbery and assault. However, this was a case of mistaken identity, as proven by his attorney, who referred to him as a refined, well-mannered young man.</p><p>It is unknown how close Bradley and his step mother are but they would definitely have a cordial relationship as they have all been pictured together on the red carpet.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/the-gumbels.jpg alt width=696 height=457 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3><strong>Jillian Beth Gumbel</strong></h3><p>Jillian Beth Gumbel is the second child of Gumbel and his ex-wife.

The yoga instructor also co-founded a company that takes people on adventures and keeps them healthy and hydrated.</p><p>Jillian Beth Gumbel got married to William Russell Robins, with whom she welcomed two sons, Alan Robins and Bryant. They tied the knot at the same venue as her father, Bryant, and stepmother, Hilary, at the Breakers Resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 11, 2011. Since there is no news of any scandal with her stepmother, we believe that they maintain a close relationship.</p><h2><strong>What Does Bryant Gumbel’s Wife Do For A Living?</strong></h2><p>Hilary Quinlan, on her path, has made a decent living with the diverse careers she has towed over the years.
