I didn’t know whether any of us was offside or not.</p><p>“It doesn’t have any influence because there was no one close to him, so it doesn’t make any influence on the (City) team-mates to defend. The only one (defender) close was one close to me. It is what it is. It’s a goal, at the end, and we are really happy for that.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>City manager Pep Guardiola said: “Rashford is offside, Bruno is not offside, the question is interference. When one player from 18-yard box shooters and one player is in front of the keeper but doesn’t touch the ball, it is disallowed all the time.</p><p>“The situation and the decision is the referee’s, the VAR, our defenders make a line (for Rashford), if we know it’s Fernandes we don’t make the line, we follow the action, and after the action the interference for Edi (Ederson).</p><p>“This is the decision in this stadium with the referee and the VAR. After conceding a goal we cannot concede the next one, this is the most important detail we have to improve in the future.</p><p>“Are we going to make a complaint? No. It sometimes happens on our side.</p><p>“The decision is they didn’t believe Rashford was intervening in this stadium. This is Old Trafford, we have to play much better, like Anfield, we have to do better.”</p><h2>What did the goal mean?</h2><p>It was crucial in the context of the game.</p><p>City had been the better team since half-time and were 1-0 ahead courtesy of a <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jack Grealish</a> goal.</p><p>Fernandes’ equaliser was swiftly followed by a goal from Rashford to put Erik ten Hag’s team ahead.</p><p>It put United on the way to a win that puts them into third just a single point behind City.</p><p>The win also moves them straight into the title picture — remarkably, given their bad start to the season — as they would be just six points behind current leaders <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Arsenal</a>. Arsenal, though, will have a game in hand.</p><h2><b data-stringify-type=bold>How did the managers react to the goal?</b></h2><p>Erik ten Hag clearly was surprised it had been allowed.</p><p>He admitted: “I wouldn’t be happy if my team conceded a goal like this. You saw the reaction from the other team.”</p><p>He also told BT Sport: “I can see it from the other side as well. The rules, it’s a confusing moment for the back line of the opponent. The rules say Marcus didn’t touch the ball and he wasn’t interfering. Bruno came from the back — but I can see it from the other side.”</p><p>(Photo: Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2lwaWxobXxzfJFsZmlpX2aBcK7RrqWoZZaav6%2BtzZ2crGWXpK6tec6fnayhlJp6rq3NnJ%2Beq6Sav27BzaKrnpxdmLa1xY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-was-bruno-fernandes-goal-allowed-to-stand-against-manchester-city.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-was-bruno-fernandes-goal-allowed-to-stand-against-manchester-city.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-was-bruno-fernandes-goal-allowed-to-stand-against-manchester-city.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-was-bruno-fernandes-goal-allowed-to-stand-against-manchester-city.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-was-bruno-fernandes-goal-allowed-to-stand-against-manchester-city.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-was-bruno-fernandes-goal-allowed-to-stand-against-manchester-city.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alexandra-golovanoff.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alexandra-golovanoff.html>Alexandra Golovanoff</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-fantasy-football-fallout-from-cam-akers-trade-to-the-minnesota-vikings-is-alexander-mattison.html>The fantasy football fallout from Cam Akers trade to the Minnesota Vikings: Is Alexander Mattison</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-fantasy-football-fallout-from-cam-akers-trade-to-the-minnesota-vikings-is-alexander-mattison.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
