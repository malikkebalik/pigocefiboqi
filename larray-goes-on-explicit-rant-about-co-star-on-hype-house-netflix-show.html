<time>12 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It is no surprise that TikTok has given rise to various influencers. And those influencers have a massive fanbase.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As a result, the platform has made them mainstream, even to the extent of having their own&nbsp;shows. One such show is Hype House on Netflix.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The show features TikTok's content house members of the same name and their day-to-day life. The eight episodes comprise their love life, career, fights, and controversies.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After the show came out, a few influencers were unhappy with their representation. One of them was <a href=# rel=follow>Larray</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Larray Blames' Hype House' Netflix</h2><p>Larray was a member of the Hype House for almost a year in 2020. As a result, he was featured on the <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Netflix show</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The series addressed some controversies he had been in, like going to a party after being tested for COVID-19. It also featured the ups and downs of his friendship with <a href=# rel=follow>Nikita Dragun</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The show Hype House has received&nbsp;criticism and is trending on Netflix USA. However, the influencer does not seem happy with the show and how he was portrayed on it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On January 10, 2022,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Noah Beck</a> uploaded a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube video</a> titled "Larray opens up about the Hype House Reality Show!"&nbsp;As explained by the title itself, he&nbsp;talked about the series and his opinion of&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p><p>He said that he was painted to be the bad guy on the show. Then he went on an explicit rant about people, but it was bleeped out.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Later in the video, the TikToker said people were jealous of him, so they painted false narratives.</p><p>Similarly, he said he would rather never be in a reality show again because of the drama.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Larray taking a mirror selfie.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>While neither Beck nor the TikToker revealed who the "people" were, it is possible that the latter was talking about Dragun.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Larray and Nikita Dragun Beef&nbsp;</h2><p>The show featured the influencer&nbsp;and Dragun as they navigated their friendship. While they refer to each other as best friends, it seems like they are more like frenemies.&nbsp;</p><p>In one instance, the two did not speak for weeks since Dragun claimed the TikToker threw her under the bus. He had COVID-19, and the show's entire production had to be shut down.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Similarly, all members of Hype House and their acquaintances had to go under quarantine. However, Dragun was partying during those times, and she allegedly knew that her friend had COVID.&nbsp;</p><p>But according to Larray's team and management, Dragun got drunk and forced him to come to the party. Her team informed her about the situation days after the party.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Nikita Dragun posing for a picture.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She maintained she did not call him, and he came to the party of his own volition. His&nbsp;team dubbed her the "scapegoat," and Dragun was hurt by&nbsp;his&nbsp;actions.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The two talked to each other after a week of Dragun avoiding the TikToker. They talked it out, only to figure out that he did not know about the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Later in the show, the influencer&nbsp;talked about how his fans did not like him hanging out with Dragun. This was because of her controversies and the number of times she has been canceled.&nbsp;</p><p>He also called out Dragun for blackfishing, but she did not respond properly. The TikToker&nbsp;confessed he felt gaslighted by Dragun.&nbsp;</p><p>But since he&nbsp;did not mention which person he was talking about, this is mere speculation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So, unless he&nbsp;confesses who he was talking about, we will not know for sure.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSRp7%2BixYyhsKmdXZ28tr%2FEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flarray-goes-on-explicit-rant-about-co-star-on-hype-house-netflix-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flarray-goes-on-explicit-rant-about-co-star-on-hype-house-netflix-show.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flarray-goes-on-explicit-rant-about-co-star-on-hype-house-netflix-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flarray-goes-on-explicit-rant-about-co-star-on-hype-house-netflix-show.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flarray-goes-on-explicit-rant-about-co-star-on-hype-house-netflix-show.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flarray-goes-on-explicit-rant-about-co-star-on-hype-house-netflix-show.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./patricia-kalember-net-worth-movies-married-children-facts-wiki-bio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./patricia-kalember-net-worth-movies-married-children-facts-wiki-bio.html>Patricia Kalember Net Worth, Movies, Married, Children, Facts, Wiki-Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./josh-mcdaniels-arrested-and-charged-is-he-in-jail.html>Josh Mcdaniels Arrested And Charged: Is He In Jail?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./josh-mcdaniels-arrested-and-charged-is-he-in-jail.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
