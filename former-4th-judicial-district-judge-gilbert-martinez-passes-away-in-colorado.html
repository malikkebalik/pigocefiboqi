The sad news was confirmed through a heartfelt social media post, where a close friend paid tribute to Judge Martinez as a remarkable human being and a dear friend.</p><p>Born in Trinidad and raised in the Denver region, Judge Martinez was a proud native of Colorado. He made significant contributions to the state’s judicial system, having been appointed to the Fourth Judicial District Court in 1989. His dedication and competence were evident as he was re-elected to six-year terms in 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010, and 2016.</p><p>Judge Martinez’s legal journey began with a civil engineering degree from the University of Colorado, followed by a J.D. from the University of Colorado Law School in 1977. Before his appointment to the bench, he served as the head of the Colorado Springs Public Defender’s Office, showcasing his commitment to justice and public service.</p><p>Throughout his illustrious career, Judge Martinez demonstrated a deep commitment to community service. He actively participated in voluntary initiatives, including presiding over Teen Court and high school mock trial programs. He was known for his engaging speeches at career days and events for students of all ages. Most of his cases involved domestic relations, and he served as Chief Judge twice, from 1994 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2016. In addition to his judicial duties, he oversaw the probation division and handled trial court administration tasks.</p><p>Guillermo Garibay shared a post on fb:</p><p>My compadre, the honorable Gilbert Martinez passed last night. A close friend and one of the most decent humans you could ever meet has left us. I knew him from our law school days at CU and our brief careers as legal service attorneys . When I first transferred to the CS Public Defender office, I stayed a week with Gil and his wife Joanie, in their home. He was my boss as a PD and i saw first hand the passion he had fighting for his clients.</p><p>As a judge, I recall how he did what was right regardless of repercussions he personally might face. I still recall the night we discussed the advisability of his recusing himself from a divorce case where a crazed husband was threatening him. This crazed man was later convicted of attempted murder after firing a sniper rifle with the bullet passing just inches away from Gilbert and his wife Joanie. I remember how after he was appointed to the bench i has planned to have lunch with him. I was waiting on him on his courtroom where he was ruling on a criminal preliminary hearing. He dismissed the case, ruling the prosecution had not presented sufficient evidence.</p><p>I think he was really showing off to me, that even as a judge he still has some public defender in him. I normally do not speak so kindly of judges, but he had the perfect temperament for that job. He was a people person who dearly loved his family. He was the consummate professional who did not forget where he came from. He Is a hero that will be dearly missed by those that were lucky enough to know him</p><p>Judge Martinez was not only a respected professional but also a dedicated family man. Described as having the perfect temperament for his job, he always prioritized doing what was right, regardless of personal consequences. He was deeply devoted to his wife, Joanie, and his love for his family was evident in all aspects of his life.</p><p>The passing of Judge Gilbert Anthony Martinez has left a void in the legal community and the hearts of all who knew him. His legacy of integrity, compassion, and professionalism will continue to inspire generations of judges and lawyers in Colorado.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ks7C%2BzJ6pZmyknXqrwcOimqKZnGKxqr%2FTq6CcrF2fwqWzxGaeoqSSmr%2B1ecyaqa2hnprHbrzArKqeq12WxKLFjKKlZpufobyzrcOoZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fformer-4th-judicial-district-judge-gilbert-martinez-passes-away-in-colorado.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fformer-4th-judicial-district-judge-gilbert-martinez-passes-away-in-colorado.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fformer-4th-judicial-district-judge-gilbert-martinez-passes-away-in-colorado.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fformer-4th-judicial-district-judge-gilbert-martinez-passes-away-in-colorado.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fformer-4th-judicial-district-judge-gilbert-martinez-passes-away-in-colorado.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fformer-4th-judicial-district-judge-gilbert-martinez-passes-away-in-colorado.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./know-the-relationship-status-and-net-worth-of-american-writer-lux-alphtraum.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./know-the-relationship-status-and-net-worth-of-american-writer-lux-alphtraum.html>Know The Relationship Status and Net Worth of American Writer, Lux Alphtraum</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dorothea-dix.html>Dorothea Dix</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dorothea-dix.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
