<time>21 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The lovely <strong>Sophie Dymoke</strong> is not involved in the media world neither she knows the glamour industry. However, she often makes headlines for her relationship with an English actor, <strong>Matthew Goode</strong>. Miss Dymoke gained fame after she married her Chasing Liberty' star husband. Just like <a href=#><strong>Chelsea Kilgore</strong></a> who became famous after her marital relation with renowned basketball player J.J. Redick. So, today, this article aims to provide some insight into her personal life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Sophie Dymoke?</h2><p>Sophie Dymoke is a celebrity partner of the talented actor, Matthew Goods. He is known for movies like <i>Chasing Liberty, The Imitation Game, The Crown, A Single Man,</i> etc. among others.</p><p>Apart from her relation with Goods and her profession, nothing much is known about Dymoke. But per some reliable sources, Sophie was born around 1982; hence her age is 37 years. Also, she hails from Tunbridge Wells hometown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/6/SophieMatthew-1567749406414.jpg><p>She attended the Sacred Heart School located in Tunbridge Wells. Later, she graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the University of Wales. By <i>2002</i>, she was working as the Head of Sales for a company called, <i>Alice+Olivia</i>.</p><p>Afterward, Dymoke started working for a company called Vince as a Sales director. Since 2012, she has been working for <i>MiH Jeans</i> as the Sales Director. Also, she is an interior designer.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>The stunning Sophie Dymoke is a married woman. She has been married since <i>2014</i> and shares three children with her spouse. To date, there are no rumors of the couple's separation, neither they have been involved in any controversy.</p><h2>Husband</h2><p>Back in 2005, Sophie began dating her boyfriend, Matthew. The couple lived together as partners for nine years and finally married each other in <i>2014</i>. Further, they haven't revealed about their first encounter and the beginning of their romance yet.&nbsp;But few sources claim that they met through mutual friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/6/Sophie_and_Matthew-1567747341323.jpg><p>Despite being a celebrated actor, Matthew often told the media to stay away from his personal life. Hence we can say that Goode doesn't see his private life as a public concern.</p><p>During their relationship, the couple had a daughter and fans immediately speculated that they were already married. However, the lovebirds maintained a low-profile and only married after nine long years.</p><h2>Children Matilda&nbsp;Teddie&nbsp;& Ralph</h2><p>Yes, Dymoke and her partner of 14 years share three children altogether. They have two daughters, <strong>Matilda Eve Goode</strong> (b: <i>March 2009</i>) and <strong>Teddie Eleanor Rose Goode</strong> (b:<i> September 2013</i>). Likewise, they also welcomed their third child; a son named <strong>Ralph Goode</strong> (b: <i>August 2015</i>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/6/Somatdau-1567747460803.jpg><p>As of now, Sophie and her husband have a healthy relationship. To date, they are not involved in any rumors or controversies. Hence, we can say that their marital relation is blissful.</p><p>The family often split their time between the U.S and U.K due to Goode's profession. Some sources claim their permanent residence in the UK.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>The details about Sophie's net worth and earnings are unavailable. But we know that she works at the MiH Jean company as their Sales Director, so her income might be pretty good. By assumption, we can say that Dymoke has a net worth of over <strong>$300,000</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/6/Somat-1567749486950.jpg><p>On the other hand, her spouse, Matthew, has a whopping net worth of <strong>$3 million</strong>. Throughout his career, Goode played the lead character in the hit movies and TV shows. Some of his films have generated an excellent revenue at the Box-Office such as <i>Allied, The Imitation Game, Watchmen,</i> among others.</p><h2>Income</h2><p>The average salary for an interior designer varies according to the nature of the project. Per year their income ranges from <strong>$25,000</strong>-<strong>$56,000</strong>. Hence, Sophie also might earn in the same range. Likewise, she is also a sales director therefore, her earning is over <strong>$98,000</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqymqaCZmnqlxcyoop4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsophie-dymoke-married-husband-kids-net-worth-income.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsophie-dymoke-married-husband-kids-net-worth-income.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsophie-dymoke-married-husband-kids-net-worth-income.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsophie-dymoke-married-husband-kids-net-worth-income.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsophie-dymoke-married-husband-kids-net-worth-income.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsophie-dymoke-married-husband-kids-net-worth-income.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-lashae-dating-boyfriend-net-worth-makeup-facts-wiki-bio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-lashae-dating-boyfriend-net-worth-makeup-facts-wiki-bio.html>Taylor LaShae Dating, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Makeup, Facts, Wiki-Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./renee-lawless.html>Renee Lawless</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./renee-lawless.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
