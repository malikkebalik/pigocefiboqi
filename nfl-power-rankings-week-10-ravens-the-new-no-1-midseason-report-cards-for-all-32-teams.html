It has allowed nine touchdowns (first in the league) and scored 27 (third in the league) this season, and its point differential (plus-115) is the best in the league and 35 points higher than second place.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: vs. Cleveland Browns, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</p><p>(Last week: 1)</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Beat Dallas Cowboys 28-23</p><p><strong>Report card</strong>: A</p><p>Philadelphia fans are not going to be happy falling a spot after a <a href=#>win over the Cowboys</a>. That’s fair, but the Eagles were outgained 406-292 by <a class=ath_autolink data-id=39 href=#>Dallas</a> on Sunday, and there are a couple of areas of concern to monitor. The Eagles have averaged fewer than 100 rushing yards in their last four games (86.8), and they are 20th in the NFL in yards per play allowed (5.3). Big picture though, they are 24-5 dating to 2022 and have established themselves as the clear favorite in the NFC.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: Bye</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>NFL Coach of the Year, MVP candidates and biggest surprises at midseason: Sando's Pick Six</p></a><h2>3.

The Chiefs are third in the NFL in defensive EPA per drive (.70), according to TruMedia. If there’s a worry, it’s that four of Kansas City’s seven lowest offensive success rate games in the Patrick Mahomes era have come this season. Sunday was its third lowest in that span (36.1).</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: Bye</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>4.

And this is not a team that has mortgaged its future. The Lions are eighth in the league in available cap space for 2024 ($73.3 million), according to Over the Cap.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: at Los Angeles Chargers, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/11/06161238/GettyImages-1777282024-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Bengals receiver Tee Higgins had a big game against the Bills on Sunday night.

Since Week 5, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MHPQIoyRCSO0fiiE href=#>Joe Burrow</a> leads the NFL in completion percentage (75.8), is third in offensive EPA per dropback (.15) and has 10 touchdowns against two interceptions. Getting <a class=ath_autolink data-id=TbtHrFRp7Lrr9gRR href=#>Tee Higgins</a> unlocked Sunday night, with a season-high 110 yards, feels like a notable development for this team.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: vs. Houston Texans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</p><h2>6.

They averaged 33.4 points in their first five games and started 5-0. They have scored 17 points in each of the last three weeks and lost all three of them. Quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0ItM9ROZC8mOtKOv href=#>Brock Purdy</a> is shouldering a lot of the blame, but the running game might be the real culprit. From Week 6 through Week 9, San Francisco was 17th in the league in rushing (95.3 ypg). Before that, it was third (156.4 ypg).</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: at Jacksonville Jaguars, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</p><h2>7.

But they have created more turnovers (2.25 per game) than anyone in the league and are ninth in point differential (plus-37).

Seattle was eighth in the NFL in rushing yards allowed (96.9 per game) entering Sunday’s game. Baltimore rushed for 298, the second-most surrendered by any team in a game this season. Still, we’ll give Pete Carroll the benefit of the doubt on defense, and the Seahawks still are tied for the NFC West lead.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: vs. Washington Commanders, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/11/06161539/GettyImages-1776860617-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Quarterback Deshaun Watson is back and the Browns are looking good.

The Browns are looking like they are going to be a real part of the postseason mix. The only reason their grade is not higher is the production doesn’t quite match the investment. Only the Ravens are investing more cash into this season than the Browns ($281.4 million).</p><p><strong>Up next:</strong> at Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</p><h2>11.

Dallas Cowboys (5-3)</h2><p>(Last week: 9)</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Lost to Philadelphia Eagles 28-23</p><p><strong>Report card</strong>: C-plus</p><p>The Cowboys always get graded harshly because of their place in the league’s history and owner Jerry Jones’ penchant for drawing a bull’s-eye on his squad. This year, the spotlight is all the brighter because Mike McCarthy jettisoned offensive coordinator Kellen Moore and designated himself the man to take Dallas over the top. Instead, the Cowboys are now 0-2 in their showdown games (against San Francisco and Philadelphia) and they are middle of the pack offensively (14th in yards per play, 5.3).</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: vs. New York Giants, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET</p><h2>13.

Through that lens, this team (which ranks 26th in the league at 4.7 yards per play), feels less than what it should be. Pittsburgh is the 34th team since 1933 to be outgained in each of its first eight games and is the only team from that list to have a winning record after eight games, according to ESPN.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: vs. Green Bay Packers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>NFL Week 9 takeaways: Chiefs win despite quiet offense; is C.J.

The 10th-year wide receiver is 15th in the league in receiving yards (594) and 11th in yards per catch (16.1).</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: vs. Tennessee Titans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</p><p>(Last week: 18)</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Lost to Green Bay Packers 20-3</p><p><strong>Report card</strong>: C</p><p>With <a class=ath_autolink data-id=TH3T20BT4e9naV0O href=#>Brett Rypien</a> starting in place of injured Matt Stafford (thumb), the Rams gained 187 yards. That’s their second-lowest total since 2020. (The lowest was 156 yards against the Packers last season with Baker Mayfield at quarterback.) Los Angeles has a bye this week, and Stafford could come back in Week 11. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=HgRXWnAZtJE84mtV href=#>Stetson Bennett</a>, who was drafted in the fourth round, remains on the non-football injury list and is not likely to return this season, Sean McVay said.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: Bye</p><h2>27. Denver Broncos (3-5)</h2><p>(Last week: 20)</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Bye</p><p><strong>Report card</strong>: D-plus</p><p>Denver traded three players, three first-round draft picks and three second-round draft picks to acquire <a class=ath_autolink data-id=iJrFtUU6uxSN7miK href=#>Russell Wilson</a> and Sean Payton. For all that, the Broncos are 26th in the league in point differential (minus-54). Wilson, at least, has made strides from his disastrous first season in Denver. He has 16 touchdowns versus four interceptions, is fifth in the league in passer rating (101.7) and has the second-lowest off-target percentage among starters (6.9 percent).</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: at Buffalo Bills, Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>28. Chicago Bears (2-7)</h2><p>(Last week: 31)</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Lost to New Orleans Saints 24-17</p><p><strong>Report card</strong>: D-plus</p><p>Why don’t the Bears get credit for having the Nos. 2 and 3 picks, at the moment, in the upcoming draft when Arizona gets an A? Because it feels more like the result of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=35 href=#>Carolina</a>’s panic than a discernible Chicago plan. The Bears have only three picks in the top 100 of the 2024 draft. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=sRMHu89uSoOMDWGY href=#>Tyson Bagent</a> is a fun story, but he’s not a plan. He’s thrown five interceptions in the last two weeks. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZOZNyO5HimYRdNoh href=#>Justin Fields</a> might be back this week, and the Bears need him.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: vs. Carolina Panthers, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET</p><h2>29. New York Giants (2-7)</h2><p>(Last week: 28)</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Lost to Las Vegas Raiders 30-6</p><p><strong>Report card</strong>: F</p><p>It’s gotten so bad that the Giants aren’t even fun to pick on anymore. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=OeqLvbJNbGyXeJqu href=#>Daniel Jones</a> returned from a neck injury Sunday and promptly suffered a season-ending ACL tear. Backup quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2YDyFWUWdEvu4KCf href=#>Tommy DeVito</a> gives New York a great chance to get into the top-two pick conversation, but would the Giants take a quarterback high after giving Jones a big contract in the offseason? The answer is probably yes because New York can get out of the deal relatively cheaply ($22.2 million in dead money) after next season.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: at Dallas Cowboys, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET</p><p>(Last week: 29)</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Lost to Washington Commanders 20-17</p><p><strong>Report card</strong>: F</p><p>The Patriots have the same record as the Giants yet are still fun to pick on. That’s the cost of having dominated the league for so long. Folks tend to savor your ensuing misery more, and things are pretty miserable in New England. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=18zaLFAmDNfVSyfc href=#>Mac Jones</a>, the Patriots’ first-round quarterback from 2021, is not good and for some reason threw the ball 44 times Sunday. He is ninth in the NFL in attempts this season (304) and 29th in yards per attempt (6.1).

They have executed their rebuilding plan exactly how they planned. They had to trade away Josh Dobbs and start <a class=ath_autolink data-id=eyGCotopdODpVQ92 href=#>Clayton Tune</a> (who had 58 yards and a 20.8 passer rating Sunday) to keep the tanking train on track, but so be it. Now, all eyes turn to how Arizona handles <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NS1S9ZYKzjSSbF41 href=#>Kyler Murray</a>, who is healthy enough to play but might help this team win games.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: vs. Atlanta Falcons, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</p><h2>32.

Rookie Bryce Young had his lowest passer rating of the season (48.3) Sunday against a Colts team that has the 26th-ranked defense in the league by yards allowed. In what has become a weekly occurrence, Carolina coaches and teammates rallied behind Young after the game, but somebody is going to take the fall for this soon it seems.</p><p><strong>Up next</strong>: at Chicago Bears, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET</p><p>(Top photo of Gus Edwards and Ronnie Stanley: Patrick Smith / Getty Images)</p><p>“The Football 100,” the definitive ranking of the&nbsp;<a class=ath_autolink href=# rel=noopener data-id=2>NFL</a>’s best 100 players of all time is on sale now.
