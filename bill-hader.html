He was the first child of William Thomas Hader and Sherri Reece. He was given the name William Thomas Hader Jr. His father owns an air cargo company and also works as a restaurant manager and truck driver. His father, like Bill, was a stand-up comedian on the side. Sherri, his mother, was a dance teacher. He has two sisters, Katie and Kara.</p><h2><span id=Education>Education</span></h2><p>Patrick Henry Elementary School was where he finished his education. As he grew older, he attended Edison Junior High School before enrolling at Cascia Hall Preparatory School, where he earned his high school diploma.</p><h2><span id=Bill_Hader-_Relationship_Married_Life>Bill Hader- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>After co-starring in the film The To-Do List with Rachel Bilson, Hader began dating her in 2019. The couple made their debut appearance at the 77th Golden Globe Awards in 2020, but it was announced in July 2020 that they had split up.</p><p>Hader married Maggie Carey, a writer, and filmmaker, in 2006. Their three daughters are Hannah, Harper, and Hayley. Hader filed for divorce in December 2017, following the couple’s breakup announcement in November 2017. The uncontested divorce was negotiated in March 2018, and it was finalized three months later.</p><p>There are reports that the actor is dating Anna Kendrick in late 2020 or early 2021. Someone revealed that the couple has been dating quietly for a year. They both appeared as co-stars in the Disney + Christmas feature Noelle.</p><h2><span id=Bill_Hader-_Professional_Career>Bill Hader- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Also, Hader was never very interested in books or studies, preferring instead to watch television, movies, and British comedy. During his high school years, Bill became involved in filmmaking with a group of friends. He has also presented “You Can’t Do That,” a student-produced television show that aired on Channel One.</p><p>Bill relocated to Los Angeles in 1998 to pursue his passion for filmmaking. He dropped out of college because his parents let him pursue his dreams. In fact, Bill stated in one of his interviews that his parents gave him the money that they had saved for his education expenditures. He began working as a Production Assistant after a lot of hard work.</p><p>Hader worked all hours of the day and night. He worked on film sets for James Dean, Spiderman, and Collateral Damage. Between 1999 and 2004, he put forth a lot of effort and difficulty. He began concentrating on his comedic career in 2003 when he formed the Animals from the Future comedy group with his buddies. He has appeared in numerous projects, shows, and films.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Giacomo Raspadori</a>, <a href=#>Ivan Rakitic</a>, and <a href=#>Ysabelle Wallace</a>.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Comedian</a> <a href=# rel=tag>writer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Lemogang Tsipa</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Eric Coomer</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfl7atuIyhmJ2domQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbill-hader.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbill-hader.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbill-hader.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbill-hader.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbill-hader.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbill-hader.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./j-cole-s-height-how-tall-is-j-cole.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./j-cole-s-height-how-tall-is-j-cole.html>J.
